# Relocation Social Insurance Program - Storslysia Case Study
CELery - University of New South Wales

# Executive Summary
With climate-related catastrophes increasing over time in Storslysia, its residents face the imminent threat of displacement, and the economy faces a decline due to the costs of supporting impacted individuals. The team has been tasked with alleviating the adverse financial impacts of climate change by designing and implementing a long-term social insurance program. This report will outline the program’s design and the method for pricing under two climate scenarios.

The final program to be utilised offers two solutions to minimise cost and maximise results. The first is to incentivize residents in high-risk areas to voluntarily relocate which will mitigate larger costs later, and the other is to help impacted individuals who are permanently displaced because of a catastrophe. To incentivise relocation, the program offers a 20% above-market price buy-back scheme to households considered to be high-risk; this is capped at 2000 houses per year to avoid excessive claims. For those involuntarily displaced, a lumpsum payment will be distributed, calculated based on the property damage value per household, as well as income support and accommodation expenses for those applicable. The values we have calculated are a result of strenuous testing and comparisons to obtain an optimal solution.

Our proposed program restricts the cost associated with relocation (voluntary or climate-induced) to 10% of Storslysia’s GDP every year. This is significantly lower than without the program and shields the economy from negative financial ramifications. We recommend that both streams of the program be run simultaneously as promoting voluntary relocation will greatly reduce larger costs down the line resulting from forced displacement.

# Objectives
## Key metrics

# Program Design
The proposed program provides financial support for households in high-risk areas to voluntarily relocate or to recover after being affected by a catastrophic event. Households are encouraged to voluntarily relocate through a buyback scheme which provides financial assistance to encourage residents in vulnerable areas to voluntarily relocate to a lower-risk area, therefore minimising costs from the involuntary scheme. Properties bought back will become government-owned and deemed unhabitable after the buyback.

## Voluntary Scheme
### Eligiblity to claim
Citizens over 18 years old are eligible to apply for the buyback scheme if they are an owner of a property in a high-risk region. Only one owner per property can apply. Applications are submitted every two years and reviewed on a case-by-case basis and the top 2000 properties most at risk of property damage from a catastrophic event are selected. Successful applicants must relocate to a low-risk region. The number of eligible properties is determined by ensuring that the objectives are met and adjusted according to the target voluntary relocation proportions in Table 2.

### Coverage
**Home buyback** – Claimants receive a lump sum valued at 20% above the market price of the property they currently own. The additional 20% of the lump sum above the market price serves as a financial incentive for households in high-risk areas to relocate to lower areas. Furthermore, this ensures that they can afford homes in lower-risk areas as the market prices in such areas are expected to be more costly. It also accounts for the temporary loss of income due to frictional unemployment.
**Moving costs** – Claimants can reimburse up to a maximum of Ꝕ1000 in moving costs incurred.
If a household has multiple owners, a single payment is made to the applicant and the distribution of funds is up to their discretion.
